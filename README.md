  A custom Lean 4 formalization of the Poincare conjecture,<br>
  supported by source-faithful formalizations of its mathematical references.
</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an active, incomplete formalization. The website distinguishes verified Lean declarations from statements still in progress.

## The conjecture

> [!NOTE]
> **Poincare conjecture.** Let $M$ be a closed, connected topological $3$-manifold. If $\pi_1(M)=0$, then $M \cong S^3$.

The primary [`PoincareConjecture`](PoincareConjecture/) project is organized by
the mathematical dependency structure of the proof, independently of any one
book's chapter order. Formalizations following individual books and articles
are maintained as supporting source projects under
[`formalized-sources/`](formalized-sources/).

## Current review milestones

- **Hopf-Rinow (do Carmo, Chapter 7, Section 2).** The path-regularity gap raised
  in [issue #6](https://github.com/frenzymath/Poincare-Conjecture/issues/6) is
  closed: `piecewiseRiemannianEDist_eq_riemannianEDist` identifies do Carmo's
  finite piecewise-smooth infimum with Mathlib's `riemannianEDist`.
- **Cartan-Hadamard (do Carmo, Chapter 7, Section 3).** The theorem is fully
  formalized without project axioms or `sorry`. The construction
  `hadamardDiffeomorphOfNonpos_complete` is a global smooth diffeomorphism and
  its underlying map is definitionally the exponential map, so mathematical
  and Lean review can start.
- **Cross-reference status.** Cartan-Hadamard is also complete in the
  Lee-Riemannian development. Petersen Section 6.2 remains open, which is why
  the workspace-wide milestone remains active.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome through [issues](https://github.com/frenzymath/Poincare-Conjecture/issues) and focused [pull requests](https://github.com/frenzymath/Poincare-Conjecture/pulls). Build instructions, local website preview, and the hgraph review/comment workflow are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Active work is coordinated on the [Poincare Conjecture Formalization Library project board](https://github.com/orgs/frenzymath/projects/1).

## Provenance

This is an independent formalization. A limited part of the Riemannian
geometry infrastructure was originally derived from
[OpenGA](https://github.com/MathNetwork/OpenGA) and has since been substantially
extended and rewritten. The project is built on
[Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/520045ab14e26149ee970e2e617ca04b09bde5d6).
