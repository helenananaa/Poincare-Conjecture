# Semilocally simple connectivity on sets

This file develops the unbased, pointwise form of semilocal simple connectivity used by the
universal-cover construction. It is adapted from the Mathlib drafts
[#31449](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/31449),
[#31576](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/31576), and
[#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292) by Kim Morrison, for
Stage 0.1 of the `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers` roadmap, following the earlier Tau Ceti
work in [#42](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/pull/42).

/-! ### Bridging to `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace`

The class `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace` (see
`TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.SemilocallySimplyConnected.Basic`) records the *based* form of semilocal
simple connectivity (Brazas, Definition 2.1): every point `x` has a neighbourhood in which every
loop *based at `x`* is null-homotopic in `X`. The `SemilocallySimplyConnectedAt` predicate above
is the *unbased* form (Brazas, Definition 2.2), asking the same of loops based at *any* point of
the neighbourhood. The two coincide on locally path-connected spaces, which is the setting for
covering-space theory, so the bridge below is stated under `[LocallyPathConnectedSpace X]`. -/

/-- On a locally path-connected space, the based class
`TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace` implies the unbased pointwise predicate
`SemilocallySimplyConnectedAt` at every point. -/

/-- Conversely, a space that is semilocally simply connected at each of its points, in the
unbased sense, satisfies the based class `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace`: the based
condition only asks about the loops of the unbased one that happen to be based at the point
itself. No local path-connectedness is needed in this direction. -/
