# Homogeneous pieces of the PBW map

The degree-`n` piece of a symmetric algebra is defined to be the `n`-th power of the range of its
canonical generator map, and these pieces form an internal direct sum. For a Lie algebra `L` over a
commutative ring `R`, the canonical map

`SymmetricAlgebra R L →ₐ[R] gr U(L)`

sends this submodule into the `n`-th PBW graded piece. This file packages the resulting degreewise
linear map, proves that it is surjective, and deduces surjectivity of the ambient map.

The proof uses the spanning half of PBW. A word of length exactly `n` maps to the corresponding
product of degree-one classes. A shorter word represents zero in the `n`-th successive quotient.
Consequently every class in that quotient has a homogeneous symmetric representative of degree
`n`.

The component maps also govern injectivity. An element of the kernel of the canonical map
decomposes into homogeneous terms, each of which lands in a distinct summand of the associated
graded and hence lies in the kernel of its own component map. So the canonical map is injective,
giving the linear-independence half of the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt theorem, exactly when every
component map is; the componentwise description reduces both halves to a degreewise statement,
while retaining the global associated-graded map.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwHomogeneousComponentMap`: the degreewise PBW map.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwAssociatedGradedMap_apply_homogeneous`: a homogeneous
  element maps to the corresponding direct-sum component.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwHomogeneousComponentMap_surjective`: every PBW graded
  piece has a homogeneous symmetric representative of the same degree.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwAssociatedGradedMap_surjective`: the canonical map is
  onto.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwAssociatedGradedMap_eq_map_decompose`: the canonical map
  is the direct sum of its degreewise components, read through the internal homogeneous
  decomposition of the symmetric algebra.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.pbwAssociatedGradedMap_injective_iff`: the canonical map is
  injective exactly when every component map is.
