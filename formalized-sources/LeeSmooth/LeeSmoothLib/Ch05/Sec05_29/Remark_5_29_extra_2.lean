/- Remark 5.29-extra-2 (1): `Set.SatisfiesLocalSliceCondition n S k` is already a predicate on the
subset `S ⊆ M` inside the ambient manifold `M`; it does not assume any topology or smooth
structure on the subtype `S` itself. -/
recall Set.SatisfiesLocalSliceCondition

/-- Remark 5.29-extra-2: a subset satisfying the local `k`-slice condition carries the
canonical embedded-submanifold structure from Theorem 5.8, and any Hausdorff second-countable
immersed submanifold structure on the same underlying subset is diffeomorphic to it through the
ambient inclusion. In particular, `S` can be regarded as an embedded submanifold of `M` in only
one way among ordinary real manifolds.

The unrestricted quantification over arbitrary immersed presentations is false: put the
uncountable discrete topology and the zero-dimensional smooth structure on the underlying set of
`ℝ`; the identity into the ordinary real line is an injective immersion with the same carrier,
but the source topology is not the ordinary topology.  The correction restores the textbook
second-countability hypothesis on the competing immersed realization.  Hausdorffness of `T`
follows from injectivity and continuity of `T.inclusion` into the ambient topological manifold,
so it is not assumed.  The inducing hypothesis `Topology.IsInducing T.inclusion` is not assumed:
that would already encode the missing topological uniqueness. -/
